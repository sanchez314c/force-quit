## Safety & Trust Architecture

### "Fast & Fearless, Safe & Smart" Philosophy
Users click confidently knowing invisible safety nets protect them.

### Four-Layer Protection System

#### **Layer 1: Pre-Flight Intelligence**
- **Process Classification**: Critical system processes never shown
- **Data-Sensitive Detection**: Special warnings for unsaved work
- **Safe-to-Kill Indicators**: Green lights for graceful terminators
- **Risk Assessment**: Amber warnings with smart suggestions

#### **Layer 2: Visual Warning Hierarchy**
- 🟢 **SAFE**: Smooth green glow - "Go ahead, no worries!"
- 🟡 **CAUTION**: Pulsing amber - "Check for unsaved work first"
- 🔴 **DANGER**: Red outline - "This might cause data loss"
- ⚫ **FORBIDDEN**: Grayed out - "System critical - protected"

#### **Layer 3: Emergency Protection Sequence**
```
1. Send SIGTERM (polite quit request) - 3 second grace period
2. App-specific save commands (⌘S simulation)
3. Emergency state preservation (temp files, screenshots, clipboard)
4. SIGKILL only as absolute last resort
```

#### **Layer 4: Recovery & Rollback**
- **"Undo Last Force Quit"** button (30-second window)
- **Session State Capture**: Window positions, open documents, app states
- **Intelligent Restart Queue**: Dependencies and priorities understood
- **Recovery Folder**: Preserved temp files and emergency backups
