Hello from TEST_FIXED agent! Session ID: [INSERT_SESSION_ID_HERE]

I can confirm the logging system is working! I'm receiving your mission briefing clearly for the ForceQUIT project - this sleek macOS Force Quit Utility sounds like an exciting build. 

I understand we're in Phase 1 of the 10-phase SWARM development process, focusing on the initial brainstorming and concept definition. The launch codes FLIPPED-POLES are acknowledged, and I'm ready to collaborate with the other Claude agents on this project.

The test communication is successful - I can see the project context, understand my role as a specialized AI agent, and I'm prepared to contribute to building this avant-garde, dark mode force quit utility with elegant visual feedback systems.
