Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for ForceQUIT as the REQUIREMENTS_ANALYST agent. 

**Key Achievements:**

🎯 **Transformed Vision into Specifications**: Converted the creative concepts from previous phases into precise, actionable requirements with measurable acceptance criteria.

📋 **Comprehensive Coverage**: The PRD includes:
- Detailed feature specifications for all core functionality
- User stories and acceptance criteria for each component
- Technical requirements with specific performance targets
- Security requirements with compliance guidelines
- API specifications and implementation details
- Implementation milestones with clear deliverables

🔐 **Safety & Security Focus**: Emphasized the critical safety architecture with multi-tier security, system process protection, and graceful termination sequences.

📊 **Data-Driven Approach**: Included specific metrics, KPIs, and success criteria that can be measured and validated throughout development.

🎨 **Design System Integration**: Translated the avant-garde visual design concepts into implementable specifications with exact color codes, typography scales, and animation requirements.

💰 **Business Viability**: Included comprehensive business model, pricing strategy, and go-to-market requirements.

The PRD successfully bridges the gap between creative vision and engineering implementation, providing everything needed for the next phases of SWARM development. It maintains the ambitious "Nuclear Option Made Beautiful" philosophy while ensuring every requirement is technically feasible and measurable.
