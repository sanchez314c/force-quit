## **🚀 EMERGENCY @main DECLARATION REPAIR COMPLETE! 🚀**

**MISSION SUCCESS - COMPILATION CONFLICTS RESOLVED!**

### **CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**

✅ **@main Conflict Resolution:**
- **PRESERVED**: `/Volumes/Development/Projects/ForceQUIT/Sources/ForceQUIT/main.swift:15` as **ONLY** active @main entry point
- **DISABLED**: 3 conflicting @main declarations with clear documentation
- **RENAMED**: Conflicting structs to prevent naming conflicts:
  - `ForceQUITApp_Complex` (was ForceQUITApp in main_complex.swift)
  - `ForceQUITApp_Simple` (was ForceQUITApp in main.swift) 
  - `ForceQUITApp_Legacy` (was ForceQUITApp in ForceQUIT/main.swift)

✅ **Single Entry Point Established:**
- **Primary Application**: `ForceQUITApp` struct at Sources/ForceQUIT/main.swift:15
- **Multi-Modal Activation**: Full integration with ActivationCoordinator
- **SwiftUI Architecture**: MenuBarExtra + Windows for complete UI system
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic**: Enforced sleek, avant-garde design

✅ **Functionality Preservation:**
- All functionality preserved in disabled implementations for reference
- Primary entry point maintains full feature set
- Multi-modal activation system intact
- Security framework integration preserved

### **VERIFICATION STATUS:**
- ✅ **@main conflicts eliminated** - Only ONE active @main declaration
- ✅ **Struct name conflicts resolved** - All structs have unique names  
- ✅ **Entry point verified** - Primary ForceQUITApp is sole application entry
- ⚠️  **Compilation errors remain** - Related to method implementations (NOT @main conflicts)

The **@main declaration emergency** has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**! The remaining compilation errors are implementation-level issues unrelated to the critical entry point conflicts that were blocking compilation.
