## 🔥 **MISSION CRITICAL SUCCESS** 🔥

**METHOD OVERRIDE ERRORS ELIMINATED!** Here's what I fixed:

### **✅ COMPLETED FIXES:**

1. **Removed Invalid iOS Touch Methods**: 
   - `touchesBegan`, `touchesMoved`, `touchesEnded`, `touchesCancelled`
   - These were iOS-specific and don't exist in macOS `NSGestureRecognizer`

2. **Implemented Proper macOS Event Handling**:
   - `mouseDown(with:)` - Handles mouse click events
   - `mouseDragged(with:)` - Handles mouse drag events  
   - `mouseUp(with:)` - Handles mouse release events
   - `reset()` - Proper gesture state reset

3. **Added Advanced Trackpad Support**:
   - `magnify(with:)` - Native pinch/zoom gestures
   - `rotate(with:)` - Native rotation gestures
   - `scrollWheel(with:)` - Scroll-to-swipe gesture mapping

4. **Fixed Import Issues**:
   - Added `import AppKit` for proper macOS event handling
   - Maintained existing `import SwiftUI` for UI components

### **🎯 COMPILATION STATUS:**
- ✅ AnimatedTransitions.swift compiles without errors
- ✅ No more invalid method override warnings
- ✅ Proper NSView/NSControl inheritance maintained
- ✅ All gesture recognition now uses native macOS APIs

### **🚀 ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY:**
The gesture recognizer now properly supports:
- **Mouse Events**: Click, drag, release with proper gesture detection
- **Trackpad Gestures**: Native pinch, rotate, scroll recognition  
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integrated with gesture callbacks
- **State Management**: Proper gesture state transitions

**COMPILATION CRITICAL ERRORS RESOLVED!** The touch method override issues have been completely eliminated and replaced with proper macOS-native gesture handling.
