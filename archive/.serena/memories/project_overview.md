# ForceQUIT Project Overview

## Purpose
ForceQUIT is a macOS application designed to elegantly provide users with a solution to quickly close all open applications. It serves as a master force quit utility that can safely restart everything it can possibly safely restart.

## Design Philosophy
- Dark mode, sleek, and avant-garde design with lights, indicators, switches, radio buttons and other visual UI improvements
- "Nuclear Option Made Beautiful" - transforms system crisis into elegant command choreography
- Three-tier psychology model serving Panic Users (90%), Power Users (8%), and Nuclear Option users (2%)

## Development Framework
This project utilizes the SWARM 2.0 AI-driven development framework - a proven system that transforms ideas into production-ready applications using coordinated AI swarms.
